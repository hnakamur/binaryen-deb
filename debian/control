Description: compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly
 Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly,
 written in C++. It aims to make compiling to WebAssembly easy, fast, and
 effective:
 .
  * Easy: Binaryen has a simple C API in a single header, and can also be used
    from JavaScript. It accepts input in WebAssembly-like form but also
    accepts a general control flow graph for compilers that prefer that.
 .
  * Fast: Binaryen's internal IR uses compact data structures and is designed
    for completely parallel codegen and optimization, using all available CPU
    cores. Binaryen's IR also compiles down to WebAssembly extremely easily and
    quickly because it is essentially a subset of WebAssembly.
 .
  * Effective: Binaryen's optimizer has many passes that can improve code very
    significantly (e.g. local coloring to coalesce local variables; dead code
    elimination; precomputing expressions when possible at compile time; etc.).
    These optimizations aim to make Binaryen powerful enough to be used as a
    compiler backend by itself. One specific area of focus is on
    WebAssembly-specific optimizations (that general-purpose compilers might not
    do), which you can think of as wasm minification , similar to minification
    for JavaScript, CSS, etc., all of which are language-specific (an example of
    such an optimization is block return value generation in SimplifyLocals).
